# PCI DSS

Mondido is a certified payment provider compliant to Level 1 Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) version 3.1 to provide a secure transaction for merchants and their customers. PCI compliance for merchants is required for any business accepting cardholder data. Let Mondido capture this sensitive information using one of our Hosted Window or mondido.js solutions to avoid PCI compliance issues.

# 3D-Secure

Mondido understands the need to incorporate best business practices in security. That's why we've made it easy for merchants to implement 3D Secure or “3 Domain Secure” as the industry standard identity check solution to minimize chargebacks from fraudulent credit cards, all included in our simple pricing. 3D-Secure refers to second authentication factor products such as Verified by Visa, MastercardⓇSecureCode™, American Express SafekeyⓇ, and JCB J/Secure™.

NOTE: While you can create your own payment experience, We strongly recommend using our Hosted Window or Mondido.js solution to save time in implementing 3D-Secure and client side encryption to your checkout procedure.

# SSL

Secure Socket Layer is required to securely transfer cardholder data and payment information to Mondido. It is recommended that you purchase a SSL certificate directly through a recognized certification authority such as TrustwaveⓇ, HTTPS.SE or purchase a custom SSL certificate through your current e-commerce solution.
